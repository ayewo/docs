Choosing the right [secrets management](/what-is/what-is-secrets-management/) tool is important, and we want you to have as much information as possible to make the choice that best suits your needs. Weâ€™ve created this document to help you understand how Pulumi ESC compares with HashiCorp Vault, and how ESC and Vault can be used together.

## What is HashiCorp Vault?

HashiCorp Vault is a secrets management tool that provides a centralized platform for managing and controlling access to secrets. It supports dynamic secret generation, encryption as a service, and comprehensive access policies.

## Pulumi ESC vs. Vault: Similarities {#similarities}

Like Vault, Pulumi ESC is a secrets manager for cloud applications and infrastructure. In both ESC and Vault, secrets can be stored and accessed through a CLI, SDK, or editor interface. Granular access controls can be implemented across all secrets.

## Pulumi ESC vs. Vault: Key Differences {#differences}

There are a couple of fundamental differences between Vault and Pulumi ESC. First, ESC and Vault differ in that Vault is not open source, using the Business Source License model. In contrast, ESC is fully open source and Apache 2.0 licensed. Second, Vault only stores secrets, whereas ESC stores environments, secrets, and configurations. Third, ESC provides composability of collections of secrets and configuration. Environments can be composed together from multiple other environments, enabling easy inheritance of shared configuration.

## Pulumi ESC and Vault:  Better Together

While there are differences and similarities between Pulumi ESC and Vault, they can actually be used together for a more powerful experience to store and manage infrastructure and application secrets. ESC environments can reference secrets stored in Vault. Through ESC, secrets in Vault can be organized as collections of secrets that can be versioned, branched, and composed inside other collections. With ESC, non-secret configuration can be stored alongside secrets in Vault. ESC enhances Vault, and they work better together.

Here is a summary of the key differences between Pulumi ESC and HashiCorp Vault:
