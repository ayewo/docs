Choosing the right [secrets management](/what-is/what-is-secrets-management/) tool is important, and we want you to have as much information as possible to make the choice that best suits your needs. Weâ€™ve created this document to help you understand how Pulumi ESC compares with Infisical.

## What is Infisical?

Infisical is a secrets management tool that provides a centralized platform for managing and controlling access to secrets. It supports dynamic secret generation, encryption as a service, and comprehensive access policies.

## Pulumi ESC vs. Infisical: Similarities {#similarities}

Like Infisical, Pulumi ESC is a secrets manager for cloud applications and infrastructure. In both ESC and Infisical, secrets can be stored and accessed through a CLI, SDK, or editor interface. Granular access controls can be implemented across all secrets.

## Pulumi ESC vs. Infisical: Key Differences {#differences}

There are a couple of fundamental differences between Infisical and Pulumi ESC. First, ESC and Infisical differ in that Infisical can only add and manage secrets stored in Infiniscal.  ESC supports pulling and centralizing the management of secrets from most secrets managers. Second, Infisical only stores secrets, whereas ESC stores environments, secrets, and configurations. Third, Infiniscal can only store static secrets while ESC can dynamically generate cloud provider credentials for AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. Fourth, Infiniscal has limited composablity in its environments while ESC has full hierarchical inheritance between its environments.

Here is a summary of the key differences between Pulumi ESC and Infiniscal:
